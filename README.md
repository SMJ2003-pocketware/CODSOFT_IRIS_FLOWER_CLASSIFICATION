In this project, I worked with the famous Iris dataset to build a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier that can predict the species of iris flowers based on their physical features. I began by loading the dataset and examining the first few rows, gathering information about the structure of the data, and checking for any missing values. The dataset contains several columns, including the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, with the target variable being the species of the iris flowers.

To understand the relationships between these features, I created a scatter plot to visualize the distribution of sepal length vs. sepal width, color-coded by species. I also generated a pair plot to see how all the features interact with each other. After exploring the data visually, I split it into training and testing sets and standardized the feature values using the StandardScaler to ensure that the model wasnâ€™t biased by differences in scale between the features.

Next, I built a KNN model with 5 neighbors and trained it on the training data. After making predictions on the test set, I evaluated the model's performance by calculating its accuracy, and I also examined the confusion matrix and classification report to get a deeper understanding of how well the model performed across different iris species. This process helped me gain insights into how KNN can be used to classify data based on features, while also improving my understanding of model evaluation.
